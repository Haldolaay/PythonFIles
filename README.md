Python Code for handeling PDF files - basic code - learning process
libraries: 
PyPDF2 = pdf files
re = regex
pandas = dataframes
smartsheet = don't need to explain I guess 
TODO://
//use Pandas // done
//finish Pong // not done
create a list with result extracted from file // done

index.py// test

index2.py//  this code will create a panda dataframe from the list we got from csv file
 then it'll call the smartsheet, compare the telphone column with the list we got
 then it'll merge the result in a new column in smartsheet data frame,
 this code will not push anything to smartsheet
 this file can be used without accessing anything from index.py, this file is a standalone file
 
 pong.py // pong game // work in progress
 
 speach.py// audio to text api from speach recognition // only works on the first sentance lol
